# Real-Time Fitness Coach: Human Pose Estimation for Exercise Feedback
Project Overview:

This project leverages the power of computer vision and machine learning to provide real-time feedback on fitness exercises. Specifically, it focuses on recognizing and detecting two common exercises: dumbbell lateral raises and squats. By utilizing MediaPipe for human pose estimation and OpenCV for image processing, the system can accurately analyze the user's posture and provide immediate feedback through a user-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit.

Key Features:

Real-time Pose Estimation: Accurately tracks and analyzes human body keypoints using MediaPipe.
Exercise Recognition: Identifies dumbbell lateral raises and squats with high precision.
Real-time Feedback: Provides instant audio feedback on correct and incorrect form.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive web interface built with Streamlit.
Technologies Used:

MediaPipe: For real-time human pose estimation.
OpenCV: For image processing and video analysis.
Streamlit: For creating the web interface.
Python: As the primary programming language.
Target Audience:

Fitness enthusiasts
Individuals seeking personalized fitness guidance
Developers interested in computer vision and machine learning
